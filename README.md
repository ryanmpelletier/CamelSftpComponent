# CamelSftpComponent
This is an SFTP Apache Camel component, it can be used to accept files over SFTP. When the consumer is created, an SFTP server is started, which will route the files it receives into Camel.

*This is a work in progress, and as I have time I will add instructions/modify code for increased efficiency. Currently I commited it as-is from the specific purpose it was designed for, I plan on updating it in order to make it more general purpose.
